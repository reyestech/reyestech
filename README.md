<h3>👋 My GitHub page!</h3>

<p> Here, you'll find a collection of detailed walkthroughs and showcases of my labs and projects. I document my journey by creating comprehensive guides and runbooks, which reinforce my skills and solidify continuous learning. </p>
<p> Thank you for stopping by! </p>


<h2>🎖️ About Me</h2>

<p> I am a veteran with a B.S. in Cybersecurity Technology, driven by a passion for technology, cybersecurity, networking, hands-on problem-solving, and IT automation. I actively enhance my skills through real-world experimentation and practical challenges. </p>

<p> I enjoy building and configuring PCs and managing my Homelab, where I explore and deploy various technologies. Whether running containerized applications with Docker, orchestrating systems with Kubernetes, or creating virtualized environments to test security controls and configurations, I thrive on the challenge of building and troubleshooting. I believe in learning through practical experimentation and trial and error, even if it means breaking things along the way to gain a better understanding. After all, hands-on experience is the best teacher! </p>
<p> Thank you again for visiting my page—feel free to explore my repositories to see my work in action! </p>
